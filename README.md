This feature can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isLocalControlSupported` field in `local.properties`.
This feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isLocalControlSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

Schedules allow you to automate a device by setting it to trigger an action at a given time on a specified day or days of the week.
List of operations that are supported for scheduling :
 
 - Add.
 - Edit.
 - Remove.
 - Enable/disable.

Schedule can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isScheduleSupported` field in `local.properties`.
Schedule feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isScheduleSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

### Node Grouping

Node Grouping allows you to create abstract or logical groups of devices like lights, switches, fans etc.
List of operations that are supported in node grouping :

 - Create groups.
 - Edit groups (rename or add/remove device).
 - Remove groups.
 - List groups.

Grouping can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isNodeGroupingSupported` field in `local.properties`.
Grouping feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isNodeGroupingSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

### Node Sharing

Node Sharing allows a user to share nodes with other registered users and allow them to monitor and control these nodes.
List of operations that are supported in node sharing :

For primary users:
- Register requests to share nodes.
- View pending requests.
- Cancel a pending request, if required.
- Remove node sharing.

For secondary users:
- View pending requests.
- Accept/decline pending requests.

Sharing can be enabled/disabled by setting true/false value of `isNodeSharingSupported` field in `local.properties`.
Sharing feature is optional but enabled by default.
Add `isNodeSharingSupported=false` in `local.properties` file to disable this feature.

## Additional Settings:

Settings associated with provisioning a device can be modified in the `local.properties` file.

Add below lines in `local.properties` and customize as per your requirement.
 
 ```
 transport=Both
 security=Sec1
 POP=abcd1234
 deviceNamePrefix=PROV_
 isFilterPrefixEditable=true
 isQRCodeSupported=true
